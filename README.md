## Resources
 - Visual Studio Code
 - python, pandas, plotly express, hvplot, sklearn

## Data
- crypto_data.csv
- iris.csv
- shopping_data.csv

## Objective
This project uses unsupervised machine learning to group cryptocurrencies. The data is cleaned, principal component analysis is then used to reduce the dimensions. An elbow curve is created to get the best fit for the K-Means algorithm. Clusters are predicted and graphed. This is all completed within cryptoCompare.ipynb.
